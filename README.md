# Polynomial-Computer-

##Description

This is a Polynomial Computer in Java, with user-friendly interface.Polynomials are fundamental in various fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. However, manipulating them can often be tedious and error-prone when done manually, especially as the complexity of the operations increases. Such a calculator is necessary to ensure the corectness of the performed operations and it could be used in educational environments, enhancing learning and teaching experiences.

##Objectives
 
-design a user-friendly and intuitive Graphical User Interface  
-ensure the validity of the input  
-implement the basic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division, integration and differatiation
